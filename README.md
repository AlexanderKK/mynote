# mynote
The project is focused on experimenting with the openSSL PHP module used for encrypting passwords with additional salt prefix and suffix. Generated passwords always differ from one another even if they are totally equal.
I have implemented functionality for PHP session storage, logging, security (openSSL). A user can register, log into his/her account, and add to the note.
